## How to Use
1. Navigate (in a new tab) to the [FireRTC Phone](https://phone.firertc.com/phone)
2. Open up the Javascript Console (FF: Control-Shift-K / Shift-Command-K)
3. Copy and Paste Entire Code into Console
4. Run everytime you need a new number (Automatically Saves)

## Tips and Tricks
* You can press the up arrow in the console after you have already pasted the code instead of having to paste it every time.
